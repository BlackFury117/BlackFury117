# Hi there 👋🏾

I'm **Idrissa Diallo** and I'm better known under the pseudonym of **Black Fury** ✌🏾 <br>

I'm a **Junior Frontend Developer**👨🏾‍💻 passionate about building beautiful and intuitive user interfaces ✨. I have experience with HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React, and I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills 🎯. <br>

My first project as a Frontend Developer was to build <a href="https://blackfury117.github.io/" target="_blank">my personal website</a> 🌐, where I practiced all my knowledge to make it. <br>

I'm excited to continue building projects and contributing to open-source software ✊🏾.
